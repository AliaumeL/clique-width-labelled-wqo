We prove the following theorems

\begin{theorem}
    \label{effective-image:thm}
    Let $I$ be an $\MSO$ interpretation
    from finite trees to undirected graphs.
    There exists a computable $k \in \Nat$
    such that $\image{I}$
    is $k$-well-quasi-ordered
    if and only if 
    $\image{I}$ is wqo-well-quasi-ordered.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{pouzet-2:thm}
    Let $\Cls$ be a class of finite graphs of bounded clique-width.
    Then, $\Cls$ is labelled-well-quasi-ordered
    if and only if 
    $\Cls$ is wqo-well-quasi-ordered.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{transductions-paths:thm}
    Let $\Cls$ be a class of bounded clique-width.
    Then $\Cls$ is labelled-well-quasi-ordered
    if and only if
    it does not existentially transduce
    all finite paths.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
    \label{transductions-paths:rem}
    If $\Cls$ is labelled-wqo, then it cannot transduce
    the class of all finite paths.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    If $\Cls$ is labelled-wqo, then it is NIP.
\end{remark}
