\section{Structural Graph Theory}

There have been recent results in structural graph theory.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 2.6]{DMT24}}]
    \label{monadically-dependent-patterns:thm}
    Let $\Cls$ be a graph class. Then $\Cls$ is \kl{monadically dependent}
    if and only if for every $r \geq 1$ there exists $k \in \Nat$ such that
    $\Cls$ excludes as \kl{induced subgraphs}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item all flipped star $r$-crossings of order $k$,
        \item all flipped clique $r$-crossings of order $k$,
        \item all flipped half-graph $r$-crossings of order $k$, and
        \item the comparability grid of order $k$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    \label{wqo-mon-independent:cor}
    Let $\Cls$ be a class of graphs that is 
    \kl{labelled-wqo}. 
    Then $\Cls$ is \kl{monadically dependent}.
\end{corollary}

We go beyond and prove the following class inclusions \kl{labelled-wqo} is
included in \kl{monadically existentially-path free} included in
\kl{monadically dependent}.
