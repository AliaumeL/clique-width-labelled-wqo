\section{Bad Patterns In Tree Decompositions}
\label{sec:bad-patterns}

TODOs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define the simon's factorisation theorem for trees.
    \item Check that we can assume that "all products are nice" and not just the ones
        appearing in the decomposition.
    \item Define "branch decompositions" and the "type of nodes" in a branch decomposition.
    \item Define a "bad branch"
    \item Prove that arbitrarily large bad branches violate WQO.
    \item Prove that "good branches" can be embedded into three copies of themselves
    \item Define the "good expansion" of a tree $T$ by expanding all good branches.
    \item Update the tree-decomposition of this good expansion to add \emph{non-sibling}
        idempotent nodes.
    \item Prove that the good expansions of a tree $T$ are well-quasi-ordered using a 
        suitable gap embedding.
    \item Conclude that the class of images is WQO.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:bad-forest-branch}
    Let $T$ be a tree and let $B$ be a branch of $T$.
    \textbf{TODO: define bad branch}.
\end{definition}
