\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proven that for all classes of graphs of bounded clique-width, the
\kl{wqo-wqo} and \kl{labelled-wqo} are two equivalent notions. This result is a
first step towards proving this conjecture for arbitrary classes of graphs.


\begin{itemize}
    \item A natural generalisation is to consider classes of 
        finite relational structures that are 
        of bounded \kl{clique-width} (images of finite labelled trees
        under \kl{MSO interpretations}).
        There are no main obstacles to extending our techniques,
        except that the \emph{accepting parts} 
        defining \kl{monoid interpretations} become more complex
        to handle.
\end{itemize}
