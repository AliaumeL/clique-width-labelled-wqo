abstract: |
  We study classes of graphs with bounded clique-width that 
  are well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation, 
  in the presence of labels on the vertices. We prove that,
  given a finite presentation of a class of graphs,
  one can decide whether the class is labelled-well-quasi-ordered.
  This solves an open problem raised by Daligault, Rao and Thomassé
  in 2010. From our proof techniques, we also derive
  (restricted versions of) conjectures
  of Pouzet regarding well-quasi-ordering of graphs under 
  the induces subgraph relation. 
  Finally, we provide a structural characterization of those 
  classes as those that are of bounded clique-width and 
  do not existentially transduce the class of all finite paths.
